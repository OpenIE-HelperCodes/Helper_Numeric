# Helper_Numeric

This is a helper code used while working on ONRE(https://github.com/Open-NRE) to filter required numerical sentences.

This is basically used to check if the given string is a required number. The main wrapper function is help.isReqNumber(str). 
This project is used by 'FilterNumericalSentences' and 'FetchFilteredWikiSentences'
